This is a simple multiplayer game prototype, sort of a cross between Scorched Earth and DOTA. Two tanks face off. Your tank automatically sends out a stream of troops. Try to kill the other tank's troops and not your own. As earth is destroyed, minerals are uncovered that your troops will pick up and return to your tank. Retrieving minerals allows you to buy more advanced weaponry like helicopters and bombers.
